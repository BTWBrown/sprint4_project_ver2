Sprint 4 project Version 2

This project I am taking the vehicle_us.csv and importing it into the VS Code engine in order to run EDA to make sure no errors are within the code. From there I made an app.py file where I was able to code and used data visualization with plotly.express to show price distribution based on Transmission, Odometer(mileage), fuel, and Engine type (# of cylinders). I also used plotly.express to show Price dependency on odometer, model year, and days listed.
